# SDVE and RSV Warp Points
This is the updated CJBCheatsMenu warp points for **ONLY Stardew Valley Expanded and Ridgeside Village**. This list is not inclusive of everything so if you would like to add more warp points then please add them yourself - I might get around to doing a more detailed list later. You can read how to [here](https://github.com/CJBok/SDV-Mods/blob/develop/CJBCheatsMenu/docs/author-guide.md). <br><br>

## **How to use**
1. Download all files and extract them
2. Go to `...Stardew Valley/Mods/CJBCheatsMenu/assets` and replace the `warps.json` file
3. Go to `...Stardew Valley/Mods/CJBCheatsMenu/i18n` and replace the `default.json` file
4. Run game and make sure it's all working!

## **Information**
The warp points are laid out by location with a favourites category at the beginning, which should cover *most* popular points. 
<br><br>
This includes:
<br>
* Town
* Forest
* Mountains
* Beach
* Desert
* Ginger Island
* Ridgeside Valley
* Ridgeside Surroundings (nature areas that aren't in town)
* Galdora

It is not a fully exhaustive list of every single warp point in the game, e.g. all NPC houses. However, there will be close enough warp points that will get you very close to the area. 

Hope you all enjoy it!
